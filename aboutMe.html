        <h2> Hi, I'm Sarah. </h2>
        <p> I am a junior at Brown University (Class of 2021), studying Astrophysics
          and Computer Science, with a focus on design. I love taking art classes,
          and art has been a passion of mine for as long as I can remember.
        </p>

        <p> I love finding ways to incorporate art into everything I do, both through
          my creative imagination and through clubs and organizations I am a part of.
          As leader of the Brown University Physics WiSE (Women in Science & Engineering),
          I dedicate time towards combining two things of the things I love, science and art, by
          creating posters, stickers, and logos for this incredible organization, all
          while working to make the Physics WiSE a success.
        </p>

        <p> While at Brown, I have focused my studies on Astrophysics and Computer
          Science, hoping to one day find a career that can utilize both of these skillsets
          and interests of mine. I have also participated in research during my time
          at Brown, under the supervision of Professor Jim Gates (2018), Professor
          Stephon Alexander (2019-present), and Jeff Huang (2020-present). I am currently
          working on a quantum machine learning research project with Professor Alexander,
          and am helping to build a
          <a href="https://uxfactor.cs.brown.edu/" target="_blank">new grading platform</a>
          for Jeff Huang's course this
          fall, CSCI 1300: User Interfaces and User Experience. I am also a Head TA
          for this course, and have been dedicating much time this summer towards making
          the transition to remote learning and critique-based (rather than rubric-based)
          grading a smoother one.
        </p>

        <h2> Some quirky facts about me. </h2>

        <p> In my free time, I love to ski, cook, and (surprise!) draw. I also love
          to run, both for fun and for an excuse to be outside! I try to be outdoors
          as much as I can, no matter the season.
        </p>

        <p> My last name is Syrian and is pronounced BUH-WAH-BEE. My family always
          jokes that the only word it rhymes with is "wasabi".
        </p>

        <p> I have a newfound love for fontmaking, and have already created
          my own font using the Fontself application in combination with Adobe Illustrator.
        </p>
